## Thread Server


</div>

### Description

This is an example based on the technique of using ActiveX EXE components to multithread. This code shows how to multithread without the need of a form and timer control, and also without the need of events (which are slow and no good when you want to thread a dynamic number of objects. The trick is to implement an interface). This example code is programmed in a very short amount of time, so have understanding if you find the it a bit sloppy.

I think that I don't lie when I say that you will have a hard time finding a VB multithread example (that actually works) with fewer lines of code!!

Instructions:

Compile the ThreadServer project.

Open the "Client" project, add a reference to the "threadServer" COM object and run the client.

-Good luck
